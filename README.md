This is for everyone who wants to contribute to **Sketchware Pro**'s development.

There are few things that must be taken into consideration before contributing to Sketchware Pro:

 - Make sure that you're capable to mod.
 - Showing off on other contributors is seriously **not** allowed. We're a community.
 - When you fix, add or modify something in Sketchware Pro, write an explanation about what you've done, at best as comment of the commit adding the file to the repository.

# How to contribute
Clone the repository, make changes to files, test those changes and then create a pull request in this repository. Some guidelines for commits follow.

## Commit message
When you've made changes to one or more files, you have to *commit* that file. You also need a *message* for that *commit*.

You should read these **guidelines:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/

And that summarized:
 - short and detailed
 - prefix one of these commit types:
  - `feat: ` A feature, possibly improving something already existing
  - `fix: ` A fix, for example for a bug
  - `style: ` Feature and updates related to styling
  - `refactor: ` Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
  - `test: ` Everything related to testing
  - `docs: ` Everything related to documentation
  - `chore: ` Code maintenance (you can also use emojis to represent commit types)

# Thanks for contributing
Thanks, they help to keep **Sketchware Pro** alive. It's better to have multiple people work on a project, for more ideas, less bugs
(sadly sometimes more), and generally quicker development. Each (helpful) contribution that gets thankfully accepted,
gets noted down in the "About Modders" activity. We'll contact you how to note your contributions to Sketchware Pro.
